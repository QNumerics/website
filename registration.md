# Registration

**Regrettably, registration is closed and we will not be able to accommodate more on-campus-lodging attendees. However, if you can arrange independent lodging for yourself, you are welcome to attend the lectures and hackathons -- please email [skrastanov@umass.edu](mailto:skrastanov@umass.edu) to reserve a spot**

The summer school will be held between August 12th (Monday) and August 18th (Sunday), 2024, at the Mount Ida campus of University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Classes will be held morning and afternoon on Mon-Fri, small hackathons will be held after dinner on Mon-Fri, and there will be a main hackathon wrap-up and potential project presentations on Saturday and Sunday morning.

The registration fee of 390\$ covers lodging from the evening of August 11th (Sunday) to the morning of August 18th (Sunday). A dinning hall is available on campus, but not included in the price. The dinning system of UMass Amherst's central campus has been winning [Best Campus Food](https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherst-earns-no-1-spot-seventh-time-best-campus-food-rankings-princeton-review) in the entirety of the US higher ed system for the better part of the last decade.

**The main registration period is now closed.**
